# mobile-application

## Abstract
#### This project was made during the summer training at HST (HLogic) Company.
#### The project was about a mobile application that can handle many machine learining techniques such as Object detection - Speech recognition - Text to speech and Face recognition (This part was for future intentions to finish)


#### The following images will give you a full view about the mobile application

#### This is the home page that you'll see once you open the application
![home](https://github.com/ENG-MohamedEssam/mobile-application/blob/main/images/home-screen.jpeg)
#### This is the object detection screen and as you can see it uses the phone's cam to detect objects and it has two buttons one to detect the objects and the other to toggle between front and rare camera
#### As you can see it recognized the TV Display and it uses a pretrained model for that.

#### Now you can press next as you can see at the bottom or return to home page and choose the next screen 
#### The following is text to speech, whatever you write here can be turned to speech using google services
#### and this can help the deaf to communicate with normal people by typing

#### There's also speech recognition which is also using google services, you can choose between tens of languages and whatever you say will appear as a text and that can also help the deaf in recognizing what's being said by normal people

#### The last one is face recognition and it was for future intentions to finish, so it's not functioning yet

### Note that this whole project i made in a couple of hours by myself and a team-mate helped later in modifying and organizing the view of the pages
